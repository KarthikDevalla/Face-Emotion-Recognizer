This project implements real-time human face emotion recognition using transfer learning and Haar cascades. The system can detect faces in real-time through Haar cascades from the OpenCv library. The system detects the faces using webcam and classifies the emotions using a pre-trained deep learning model such as RESNET152V2. There are wide range of emotions that the model can recognize; Anger, Contempt, Sadness, Neutrality, Happiness, Fear, Surprise and Disgust.
